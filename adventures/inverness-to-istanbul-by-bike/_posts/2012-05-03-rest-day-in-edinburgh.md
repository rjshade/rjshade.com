I couldn't resist spending another day in Edinburgh. My excuse was that my knees were feeling a bit fragile after the long ride the day before. This was true but it was also nice to spend more time with Katie, and to plan my route south from Edinburgh. If everything goes to plan I'll get to Oxford in 6 days, and be on the ferry to Holland two weeks after leaving the north of Scotland.
