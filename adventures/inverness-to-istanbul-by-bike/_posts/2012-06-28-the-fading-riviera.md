I left Nice heading west, following a wide cycle path along the seafront. I passed through lots of the famous Riviera towns; Cannes, Antibes, St. Tropez, but wasn't too inspired by them. I guess they had their heyday last century, the great seafront hotels fading in the sun. Reaching Hyeres near Toulon I found a huge campsite which seemed to be completely deserted. The showers still worked though so I set up camp and would leave again the next morning without seeing another person.
