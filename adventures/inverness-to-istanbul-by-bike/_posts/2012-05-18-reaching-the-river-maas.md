Eindhoven was badly bombed in the war and I was expecting a concrete nightmare to rival similarly afflicted cities in the UK. While not as pretty as the other towns I'd been through it was nowhere near as awful as I'd been led to believe. The bustling city centre still has some old churches which survived, and some striking modern architecture means it's not a boring place to be. That said, I didn't hang around for long!

I reached the lakes north of the river Maas as evening fell, and I camped at the edge of a field near Grathem.
