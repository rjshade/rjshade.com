Starting at the campsite I walked up the Kappelenweg, a path to Saas Fee which is lined with little chapels with models inside telling the crucifixion story. To be honest, I'd been a little disappointed when I arrived in Saas Grund. This is an area containing a lot of 4000m peaks and I couldn't see any of them - the steep walls of the valley hiding them from view.

However on reaching the top of the Kappelenweg and entering Saas Fee the glistening peaks began to appear. Even better, from the top of the Kreuzboden cable car on the other side of the valley you can see Saas Fee, surrounded on three sides by towering mountains. Much more like it.
