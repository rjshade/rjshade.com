I was now at the southern end of Corsica and it was time to head back to the mainland. I wanted to catch a ferry to Italy, to Rome or Naples, but no luck doing this from Corsica. Instead I had to take a short ferry trip to Sardinia (part of Italy, whereas Corsica is French), and then cycle 60 km or so to the town of Olbia. Strange to be hearing Italian everywhere after so long in France, and I realised that my now instinctive bonjours and mercis would have to be reprogrammed.
