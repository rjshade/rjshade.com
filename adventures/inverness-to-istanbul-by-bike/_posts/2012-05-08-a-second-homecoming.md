Blue skies, sunshine, and flatter roads as I headed south to Oxford. What a difference this makes to motivation and enjoyment! It also helped to know that Oxford, a city I'd lived in for 8 years, was waiting for me at the end of the day with friends, food, and a warm bed.

A flood of memories as I entered Oxfordshire and crossed the Cherwell River, the placenames quickly changing from those I vaguely recognised to those I was familiar with to those I had run to from the center of Oxford. From Banbury I cycled the length of the Oxford-Banbury road, past the Begbroke Science Park where I'd worked for the last few years, through Kidlington, into Summertown and leafy north Oxford, past the Engineering Department where I'd spent even more of my time, dodged the evening tourists on Cornmarket, past the great Tom Tower of Christ Church on St Aldates, over the Thames at Folly Bridge, and down Abingdon road to Matt (typically over-excited), Gabs (npt present), and Nodoka's house where a very welcome pizza was waiting for me!
