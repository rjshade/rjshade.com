In an attempt at ditching some excess weight I went for a haircut before leaving Dunfermline. The hairdresser asked me what I was up to in the afternoon and so I told her I was planning on cycling over to Edinburgh. She told me that I must be really fit to cycle that far. I kept quiet about my real goal, and said that if you just take it slowly it really isn't that bad.

I followed my own advice and took my time pedalling out of Fife over the Forth Road Bridge, and to my sister Katie's flat near Haymarket in Edinburgh. It was a lovely evening and we sat outside one of the pubs on Rose Street enjoying the sunshine. A short and enjoyable day!
