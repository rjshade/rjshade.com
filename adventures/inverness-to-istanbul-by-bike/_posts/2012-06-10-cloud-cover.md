I was here to see the mountains so another cloudy day wasn't ideal. At low levels it was clear though so I walked up to Wengen, perched high on the hillside above Lauterbrunnen. From here there are stunning views down the length of the valley; a glacial gorge comparable only to Yosemite. Yosemite doesn't have the Alps as a backdrop though, so the scale here from valley floor to the surrounding peaks is much greater.

From Wengen the path winds its way upwards to Wengeralp where the clouds began to clear a bit and I finally saw some peaks: the Jungfrau was clearly visible but as I reached Kleine Scheidegg the Eiger and the Monch were both covered again but thick cloud.
