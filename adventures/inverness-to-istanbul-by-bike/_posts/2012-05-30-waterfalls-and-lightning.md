I headed south from a secluded campsite north of Alpirsbach, along dark forested valleys and across high meadows filled with wild flowers. I stopped at Triberg to see the highest waterfalls in Germany (only later to discover that the local tourist board were being liberal with the truth, and that these were in fact the second highest). 

There were ominous clouds forming in the west so I pushed onwards to Titisee, watching as rain showers swept across the higher ground around me.
Somehow I avoided getting drenched, and got into my tent as a huge thunderstorm broke overhead.
