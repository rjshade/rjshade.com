Thessaloniki is hot. Far too hot - it reached almost 40 degrees C in the mid-afternoon. This makes actually doing anything really quite sweaty and unpleasant, but it's my first day off in almost a fortnight so I'm happy to sit around in the hostel and refuel on the unlimited breakfast buffet (3 EUR, bargain!) until they sadly clear it away around 11am.

Another benefit of this hostel: free tea, coffee, and iced frappe the Greek drink of choice. It's instant coffee mixed with a bit of water, lots of sugar, and frothed up before being poured into a tall glass, adding milk, and a couple of optional ice cubes. Passing through small Greek towns you see cafes spilling out onto the pavement, filled with people sipping frappes and trying not to move too much in the heat.
