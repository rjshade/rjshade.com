There's no question that cycling in Holland offers a lot of benefits to the cyclist: an extensive signposted cycle network, huge stretches of purpose built cycle paths, and unrelentingly flat landscapes. This is all very much appreciated but it's almost too easy; you hardly need glance at a map to stay on track, and hundreds of kilometers roll by effortlessly.

As nice as it is, I'm starting to get a bit restless as I enter yet another spotless village with cobbled streets, tall houses by the river or set back with moated gardens, and decorative trees encouraged to grow arrays of branches at right angles to the trunk by means of rigid frames. I start to think of the future and the high mountains to come. I'm sure I'll look back on Holland with longing as I'm toiling up another torturous Col, but tonight I'm dreaming of the Alps.
