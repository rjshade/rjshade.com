I'd given myself two days to get from Malham to Oxford, so today was the first half of a tough 220 mile cycle.

Yorkshire turns out to be a series of long, long hills. Nothing particularly steep, but each town (Halifax, Huddersfield, Sheffield) came complete with a gruelling slog back out into the countryside. Any charm these northern industrial towns may have was unfortunately lost on me as the morning drizzle turned to rain and I turned another corner to find yet another long hill.

There is something extremely satisfying about reaching a destination after a 12 hour day of sore legs, bad weather, and hills, but as I reached the dark and wet Nottingham city centre I was more concerned about finding food and getting to bed.
