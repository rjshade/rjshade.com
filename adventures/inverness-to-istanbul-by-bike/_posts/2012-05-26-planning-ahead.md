I spent a quiet day resting my legs after the hills of the Ardennes and Luxembourg. I bought a map covering the border region south of Saarbrucken, the Schwarzwald, and Zurich. In a week's time I planned to be in Zurich and so I took some time to plan a route through the black forest.

I met an enthusiastic Australian called Dave who would leap up from his seat at any opportunity to help illustrate a story, and his much more restrained wife Louise. They were doing their third cycle tour of Europe, and had a very sensible policy of taking a train whenever they decided that there were too many hills.
