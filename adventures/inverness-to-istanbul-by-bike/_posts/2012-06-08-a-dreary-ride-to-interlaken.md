A long slog from Lucerne to Interlaken over the Brunig pass today. The clouds had returned and were so low that any chance of getting a good view was extinguished in a thick blanket of fog. Every so often there would be a tantalising glimpse of high cliffs and cascading waterfalls but these disappeared just as quickly and the majority of the ride was dull, grey and wet. The tourist information signs in Interlaken town show beautiful views up the valley towards the Bernese Oberland, and I'm hoping to see similar views for myself over the next few days if the weather turns in my favour.
