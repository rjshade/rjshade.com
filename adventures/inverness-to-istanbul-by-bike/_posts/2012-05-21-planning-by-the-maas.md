I took a rest day and stayed in the Maastricht youth hostel Stayokay. It's right on the Maas and has a bar with a balcony overlooking the river. I spent the afternoon sitting in the sun and planning my route through the Belgian Ardennes, Luxembourg,  Germany, to ZÃ¼rich.

Later three Canadians from small-town Ontario arrived carrying guitars and completely filthy. They'd spent the last week camped out in woods just outside the city centre, coming into town each day to busk until they'd raised enough to pay for a night at the hostel, and for train tickets to take them on to the next part of their European adventure!
