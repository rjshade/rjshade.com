I now did the long climb to Saas Grund in reverse, and it's much more fun in the downhill direction. Quickly covered 20 km and reached the turning up the next valley along, to Zermatt. I took the funicular railway up to Gornergrat above the Zermatt valley and to glorious views of the Matterhorn and the surrounding peaks. Along with the Eiger, the Matterhorn has another of the famous north faces of the Alps and its striking jagged profile is instantly recognisable.

It's still a bit early in the season to be walking down from the top of the railway, as the path was in places covered in deep snow, and the Riffelsee which in summer the reflection of the Matterhorn can be seen was covered in ice. Still, this meant the path was quiet, and I saw an Ibex hopping down a rocky slope, and a nervous marmot which quickly ran off and hid under a rock.
