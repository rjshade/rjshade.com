We have lunch in Aix-en-Provence and then all too soon it's time for Kai to fly home from Marseilles airport. It's been the most fun four days of the trip having her around, and I'm very sad to be saying goodbye so soon. I'm not very excited about the prospect of cycling back along the coast towards Nice, and so I plan to cut this corner of France and northern Italy by getting a ferry to Corsica and then back to Italy, maybe to Rome or Naples.

As the ferry leaves the port in Marseilles (basically a huge construction site), a couple of jetskiers follow the ship, leaping through the wake like motorized dolphins.
