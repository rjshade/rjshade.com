Yesterday was 150 km, today another 100 km, and it's not flat! The coastal roads rise and fall from beach to clifftop and back again. The stunning views more than compensate though, today the beaches are bright and wide and huge yachts are moored just offshore. The smell of wild rosemary fills the air as I make the final descent into Porto, where there's an amazing sunset over the sea.
