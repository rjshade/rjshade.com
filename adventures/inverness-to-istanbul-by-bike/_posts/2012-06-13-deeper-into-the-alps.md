I packed up and cycled down from Grindelwald back to Interlaken, then alongside the bright blue-green Thunersee. A brief train ride through the tunnel from Spiez to Visp (I didn't back myself to carry my bike over a 3500m peak), and I began the long climb up to Saas Grund. Very strange to be cycling through the tunnels and show-sheds lining the road, preventing road closures due to snow in winter but now just providing a cool break from the heat. The more famous town of Saas Fee lies 500m above Saas Grund, but the campsites are all in the lower town. Included in the campsite price is a pass to use all the buses and cable cars in the valley for free, bargain!
