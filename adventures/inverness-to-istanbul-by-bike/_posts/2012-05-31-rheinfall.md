Germany's 'tallest' waterfall yesterday, Switzerland's biggest waterfall today, what excitement! The Rheinfall at Schaffhausen is in fact Europe's biggest waterfall (in terms of volume, not height). The full might of the Rhine boils and tumbles down a bend in the river, with the castle Laufen perched high on the inside of the corner. Two pillars of rock have survived the onslaught so far, standing directly in the centre of the flow. One of these has been carved into an arch over the millenia, and the other is large enough that you can land on it by boat and climb to the top, to be surrounded by the noise and the power of the falls.

I followed the beautiful blue-green waters of the Rhine downstream from the waterfall until crossing back into Switzerland at Kaiserstuhl. I camped on an abandoned farm track high above the valley.
