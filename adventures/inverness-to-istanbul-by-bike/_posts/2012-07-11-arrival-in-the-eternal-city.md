I caught the midday ferry from Olbia to Citavecchia, the port of Rome. From here I got the train to the centre of town (cheating a bit, but wasn't too keen on cycling into central Rome as night fell!). I got back on my bike at the Termini and cycled the short distance to a hostel. Battling with scooters for space on the road, and weaving through the evening traffic was quite an adventure but I arrived safely and took advantage of being back in a major city by getting takeaway pizza from a late night pizzeria.
