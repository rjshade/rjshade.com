I woke at sunrise, opening my tent door to a stunning panoramic view over the Mont Blanc massif, reflected in the surface of the lake I was camped beside. An amazing camping spot, well worth the long day yesterday. An inquisitive Ibex came over to investigate my tent. The day began to heat up and I walked slowly down to the valley floor down empty ski runs and through woodlands dappled with sunlight.

That evening I met up for a couple of beers with Chamonix-based Alpine photographer [Alexandre Buisse](http://www.alexandrebuisse.org/). He moved here last September to turn his passion for mountain photography into a career, and has been doing well, having been hired by companies such as Montagne and Patagonia to do shoots for them. You should check out some of his photos: [alexandrebuisse.org/galleries/](http://www.alexandrebuisse.org/galleries/)
