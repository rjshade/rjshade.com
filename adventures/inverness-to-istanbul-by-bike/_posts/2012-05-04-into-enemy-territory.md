A big day of cycling. Headed south out of Edinburgh on the A7. The road runs down through the borders, through Galashiels, Selkirk, Hawick. The rolling hills weren't dramatic, but the huge number of new born lambs in the fields to either side of the road were enough of a distraction.

I'd planed on stopping near Hawick but felt good so pushed on to the English border. I rolled into England and spent my first night on enemy soil, in some woods north of Carlisle.
