My bike repair skills could do with some work. I spent a considerable amount of time on the banks of the Saar with my bike on its back, fiddling with barrel adjusters and cable tension, trying to encourage the rear derailleur to shift lower than the highest five gears. I somehow managed to make the situation worse, and had to face the ride to Strasbourg with only the top three gears.

I followed rivers and valleys as much as possible to avoid hills, and with some difficulty made it to Strasbourg. It was a Sunday afternoon, and this being France meant that everywhere was most definitely closed, especially the numerous bike shops that I investigated.

Deciding that any repairs would have to wait until tomorrow, I crossed the Rhine and camped near the town of Kehl.
