Kai arrives in Marseilles for a few days! So good to see a friendly face again,
especially when it's your wonderful girlfriend! She tells me I've lost weight
which I use as an excuse to start eating more. Kai's US credit card reward
scheme results in us getting a cheap deal in a hotel right on the harbour in
arseilles. It's bizarre staying in a hotel after almost 60 days of tent,
bunkbeds in hostels, or couches in friend's houses.

We walk up to the Basilique for panoramic views over the city, and hop on the
Petit Train to get back to the harbour. There are streets filled with
restaurants just behind our hotel and we end up eating bouillabaisse (local
fish soup speciality) and drinking Provence ros√© wine - quite a dramatic change
from my regular diet of baguette, cheese, and maybe a packet of biscuits!

Next few days will be spent driving around Provence before Kai heads back to
the US and I get back on my bike.
