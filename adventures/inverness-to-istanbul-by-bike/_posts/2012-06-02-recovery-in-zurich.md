Kay and Mia both needed to get some work done before they left the country, and so I was on my own for the day. I'd managed to catch a cold, and I woke with a sore throat and a thick head. Thankfully the first illness I've had since leaving Dingwall!

To help with recovery, I had a quiet and relaxing day wandering slowly through the streets of Zurich, and sitting around in the sunshine. I walked down the main shopping street, Bahnhofstrasse, heaving with Saturday afternoon shoppers, and to the lake where I got my first view of the Alps: their jagged white peaks rising above the distant hills, and looking omninously high.
