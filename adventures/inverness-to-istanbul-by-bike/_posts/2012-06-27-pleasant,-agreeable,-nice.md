A day off after the long descent from the Alps. I spent the day backing up my photos and updating my blog (well worth it I'm sure you'll agree!). I wandered down into the centre of Nice to watch the football and see a bit of the town. A bustling old town, a long stretch of stony beach, and lots of grand old hotels.
