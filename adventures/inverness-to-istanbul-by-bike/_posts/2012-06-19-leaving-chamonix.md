Sad to be leaving Chamonix, but the weather had turned nastier (this photo is from a couple of days ago!) and so leaving was really the only sensible option. Cycling down from Chamonix to St Gervais can be challenging as you're constantly being pulled downwards into the potential well of the motorway running along the base of the valley. I made it down, and climbed up and over the Col des Saisies. The ski-town of Les Saisies was deserted at the top, and looked pretty miserable out of season and in the rain. I quickly pushed on and followed the road downhill to Albertville.
