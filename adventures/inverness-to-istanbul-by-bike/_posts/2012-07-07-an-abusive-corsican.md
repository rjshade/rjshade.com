Climbing steeply out of Porto towards Piana rewards you with a trip through some stunning rock formations and along roads blasted through the cliffs. The views from here back along the coast are probably the best I've seen so far on Corsica. From here it's downhill (literally, and in terms of scenery) to Ajaccio, birthplace of Napoleon. I find a campsite near the airport, nothing exciting but it does the job cheaply. A drunk Corsican berates me for not understanding him, telling me that it's disrespectful to come to France without knowing French. He then called me 'le Roast Beef' and staggered off. Brilliant.
