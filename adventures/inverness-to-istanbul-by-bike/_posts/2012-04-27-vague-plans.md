I really don't want this to be a meticulously planned trip. Even disregarding the fact that it would be almost impossible to come up with a detailed (and accurate!) itinerary for a 3 month trip, the idea of heading off with only a vague plan is exciting (and a bit terrifying).

My rough plan is as follows: Dingwall to Dunfermline, then down the west of England to Oxford. Pass through London before getting a ferry to Holland. After this I'm pretty undecided: follow the Rhine and then the Danube to the Black Sea
