I woke feeling much worse, and the sunshine had been replaced by heavy rain which battered at the windows of the flat. Motivation to leave the couch and get back on my bike was at an all time low. Kay and Mia had noticed my worsening condition and point blank refused to let me leave in this condition in the rain. Even though they were both heading to the airport - Kay to a conference in China, Mia to her parents in England - they very kindly left me with a spare key and told me I could stay in the flat until I was feeling better.

I was overwhelmed by this gesture and I'm not sure I thanked them enough, so thanks again! I couldn't have picked a better time or place to get ill, and I was (and am) hugely grateful to them both.
