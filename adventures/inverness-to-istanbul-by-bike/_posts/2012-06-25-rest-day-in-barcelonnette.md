A day off in Barcelonnette to recover and prepare for a big push south the following day. I spend my time wandering around the centre of the town, and lying out in the sun listening to Springsteen - I realised that this is actually the first time I'd listened to my mp3 player since leaving home, unsure before leaving if I'd be needing it for motivation on long rides. It turns out that there's enough sensory input from the environment, no matter where I've been cycling, that music would be an unnecessary distraction. Ideal though for relaxing in a field in the sunshine!
