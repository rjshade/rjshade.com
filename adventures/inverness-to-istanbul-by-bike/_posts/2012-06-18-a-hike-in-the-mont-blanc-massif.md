I took Alexandre's advice and walked from the Plan de l'Aiguille to Montenvers railway station. I was rewarded with views over the Bossons glacier and Mont Blanc, a panorama over the Aiguilles Rouge where I'd camped previously, and then rounding the corner above the station the Mer de Glace glacier with the famous peaks of the Drus towering above, and the north face of the Grandes Jorasses further up the valley.
