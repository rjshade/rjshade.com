Well worth taking a couple of days off to explore Rome. The hostel is within walking distance of the centre of town and I went for an aimless wander, stumbling across the Trevi fountain, the Pantheon (with the largest unreinforced concrete dome roof in the world, fact fans), and then down the river Tiber before looping back past the remains of the Circus Maximus, the great chariot racing stadium between the Palatine and Aventine hills.
