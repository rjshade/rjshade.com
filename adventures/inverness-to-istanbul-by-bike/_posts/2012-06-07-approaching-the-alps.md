Time to get going. Still a bit blocked up, but the worst of the cold is over and the sun is shining again! Rain has been forecast all week but my luck is in as I ride south to Lucerne under blue skies. Really pretty lakes and villages all with a dramatic backdrop of the Alps. Not a huge distance covered today, but I think it makes sense to ease back into it, especially given the climbing that lies ahead!
