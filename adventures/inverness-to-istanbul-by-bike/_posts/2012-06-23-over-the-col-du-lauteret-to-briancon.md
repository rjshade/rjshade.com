A cool breeze takes the edge off the heat as I leave Bourg d'Oisans and head back up to the Col du Lauteret. It's not quite the summer cycling season here so the roads are fairly quiet, and there are long stretches where the only sound I hear is my wheels on the tarmac, and the occasional creak or groan from my ageing bike. There's a great sweeping descent from Col du Lauteret down to the fortified town of Briancon, and I camp here for the night.
