The usually idyllic Bourton-on-the-water was being gently soaked by 
the Sunday morning drizzle as I returned to the site of my first ever 
proper race. I ran this course last year after a last minute space 
opened up and this was responsible for kick-starting my running 
'habit'. The course is lovely and flat and with some nice cooling 
rain today was perfect for a PB attempt - and to try and finish in 
sub-40 minutes as an added bonus. I was in fact pretty much on target 
until 6km when the seconds started slipping out from under my feet. My 
fuel reserves emptied somewhere around 8km at which point I needed to 
run 2km in under 6 minutes. Not a chance at this stage.

Target time: under 40 minutes. Actual time: 41:28. Beat last years time by 
over 7 minutes, but there is much work to be done.
