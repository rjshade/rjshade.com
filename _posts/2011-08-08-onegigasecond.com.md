Ever wanted to know when you'll be <a href="http://www.onegigasecond.com/">one gigasecond old</a>? Of course you have, and the answer is about 31.7 years after birth. I've created a website that, given your date of birth, will tell you when your next gigasecond anniversary is (as well as 10 kilo-day anniversaries), and gives you the option to add them to Google Calendar as events. Check it out at <a href="http://www.onegigasecond.com/">www.onegigasecond.com</a>

Creating this site has served two purposes: a contribution to my ongoing thesis procrastination, and an excuse to learn about <a href="http://www.jquery.com/">jQuery</a>. If everything goes to plan I'll have submitted my thesis within the next couple of weeks, and then where is my motivation for pointless projects going to come from?
