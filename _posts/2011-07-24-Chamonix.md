A week of sun, rain, and snow. Despite unsettled weather we made the most of our all-too-brief trip to the Alps -- beging British we weren't about to let a bit of rain stop us enjoying ourselves. Climbed Aiguille du Tour with a night in the Albert 1er hut, did some sport climbing at Gaillands, clambered around on the Pierre d'Orthaz boulder in Snell's field, climbed the Aiguillettes d'Argentiere, and ate and drank substantial amounts of cheese and wine.

6 days is not nearly long enough -- 6 weeks probably wouldn't cut it either, but next time I'd want to stay out for at least two weeks, both for acclimitisation and because of the variable weather. Oh, and the 14 hour drive from Oxford doesn't help. Still, fantastic time as these photos hopefully demonstrate.
