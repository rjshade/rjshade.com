title: zsh and cd

zsh's cd function has the following useful feature:

{% highlight bash %}
    $ pwd 
    /some/long/path 
    $ cd long huge 
    /some/huge/path
{% endhighlight %}

Syntax is
{% highlight bash %}
    $ cd [old] [new]
{% endhighlight %}

What this does is to find the first occurrence of `old` in the current path and
replaces it with `new`. For jumping between directory trees with similar
structures this is of much value.
