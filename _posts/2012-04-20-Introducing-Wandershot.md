title: Introducing Wandershot
---

Unable to find a simple, minimalist travel blogging platform, I've done the obvious thing and scratched my own itch by building my own. It's called Wandershot and you can find it at [wandershot.com](http://wandershot.com/). It doesn't have many features, but it does everything I want from a travel blog: ability to post photos (this is encouraged), geo-tag your posts, and to tie posts together in stories which cover a trip. Going to be test-driving it over the next month or two.
