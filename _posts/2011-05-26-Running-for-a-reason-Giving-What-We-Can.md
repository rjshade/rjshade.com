title: Running for a Reason - Giving What We Can
---

As many of you know I like to run ludicrous distances for "fun" and this summer
is no exception. On the 25th of June I'm going to be running 44 miles along the
Cornish coastal path in the Classic Quarter ultramarathon (h and as is the norm
for these sorts of things I'd like to ask you to donate something of value to a
worthy cause.

This isn't a request for donations of money however, but for a donation of
time. I'd really like it if you would spend 10 minutes reading through the
website of Giving What We Can: 
<a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/">givingwhatwecan.org</a>.
Giving What We Can is not a charity itself, but a society with the goal of
improving the lives of the world's poorest people, and they do this through two
simple ideas:

* Encouraging people to donate more to charity - the average person in the UK
  donates around 0.8% of their income and this number could and should be a lot
  higher. Try playing around with the calculators on the site to see just how
  much difference donating a small percentage of your income can make *if given
  to the right charities*. Donating to the right places is just as, if not more
  important, than how much you donate, which leads on to point 2...

* Identifying the charities which are most effective at improving lives. This
  is a huge deal - charities vary wildly in terms of lives saved/pound donated
  and thus choosing the right charity to donate to can mean the difference
  between saving one life and saving hundreds of lives. GWWC has done (and
  continues to do) the research to quantify the effectiveness of various
  charities and lists the results on their site:
  <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/resources/recommended-charities.php">givingwhatwecan.org/resources/recommended-charities.php</a>

I figure that if just one person who reads this is persuaded by the arguments
on the GWWC site then this will do far more good than I could ever do through
raising a few hundred pounds for a charity of my choice. I was certainly
convinced and I believe that most people will agree but may just have never
seen the arguments presented so clearly before.

If you want some numbers try plugging your salary in to the form found here at
<a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/resources/how-rich-you-are.php">givingwhatwecan.org/resources/how-rich-you-are.php</a> 
and you'll be told exactly how wealthy you are compared to the majority of the
world's population (hint for anyone reading this: much wealthier), and how much
this would change if you started donating 10% of your income (hint: not much
change). A second calculator, found at
<a href=" http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/resources/what-you-can-achieve.php">givingwhatwecan.org/resources/what-you-can-achieve.php</a>
will tell you how many years of healthy life you have the potential to save
given your estimated income over your lifetime - it's going to be a lot...


tl;dr: Robbie Shade, Matt Gibb, and Dave Royse run 44 miles along the coastal
path in Cornwall. You spend 10 minutes reading about Giving What We Can at
http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/. Good deal.
