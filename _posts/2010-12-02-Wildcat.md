This is our new robot - the Wildcat. Although it will have the capability to drive autonomously we are taking things slowly and so for now we have to make do with driving it ourselves. Quite a strange site on the roads, and we've already had one person drive into the side of it as they were too busy staring to pay attention to important things such as steering.

Currently equipped with a Bumblebee stereo camera, multiple SICK laser scanners, intertial sensor, and GPS. Exciting times at MRG...
