The 80,000 Hours project is really starting to take shape. We now have over [75 members](http://80000hours.org/members), and an [active blog](http://80000hours.org/blog). Our message is becoming more clear:

We believe that helping people is a good thing. We believe that you can do a vast amount of good over your working life. We believe that making the right career choices can be the difference between saving tens of lives and tens of thousands of lives.

If you want to have an ethical career then it's really worth thinking carefully about your options. Our blog highlights some considerations: [the replaceability issue](http://80000hours.org/blog/18-just-what-is-making-a-difference-counterfactuals-and-career-choice), [maximising your marginal impact](http://80000hours.org/blog/30-the-road-less-travelled-replaceability-and-neglected-causes), and what we mean by [an effective altruist](http://80000hours.org/blog/31-what-is-an-effective-altruist).

If you're interested in our ideas, or want to get involved, [visit the site](http://80000hours.org/) and [let us know your thoughts](http://80000hours.org/chat-to-us)!
