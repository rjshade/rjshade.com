  abstract:
    We present our experience with QUIC, an encrypted, multiplexed, and
    low-latency transport protocol designed from the ground up to improve
    transport performance for HTTPS traffic and to enable rapid deployment and
    continued evolution of transport mechanisms. QUIC has been globally
    deployed at Google on thousands of servers and is used to serve traffic to
    a range of clients including a widely-used web browser (Chrome) and a
    popular mobile video streaming app (YouTube). We estimate that 7% of
    Internet traffic is now QUIC. We describe our motivations for developing a
    new transport, the principles that guided our design, the Internet-scale
    process that we used to perform iterative experiments on QUIC, performance
    improvements seen by our various services, and our experience deploying
    QUIC globally. We also share lessons about transport design and the
    Internet ecosystem that we learned from our deployment.

  title: "HTTP/2 Semantics Using The QUIC Transport Protocol"
  location: "IETF RFC Draft"
  date: July 2016
  authors: Robbie Shade and Mike Warres
  abstract:
    The QUIC transport protocol has several features that are desirable in a
    transport for HTTP/2, such as stream multiplexing, per-stream flow control,
    and low-latency connection establishment.  This document describes a
    mapping of HTTP/2 semantics over QUIC.  Specifically, this document
    identifies HTTP/2 features that are subsumed by QUIC, and describes how the
    other features can be implemented atop QUIC.

  title: "Choosing Where To Go: Mobile Robot Exploration"
  location: "D.Phil Thesis, Oxford"
  date: August 2011
  authors: Robbie Shade
  abstract:
    For a mobile robot to engage in exploration of a-priori unknown
    environments it must be able to identify locations which will yield new
    information when visited.  This thesis presents two novel algorithms which
    attempt to answer the question of choosing where a robot should go next in
    a partially explored workspace.  To begin we describe the process of
    acquiring highly accurate dense 3D data from a stereo camera. This approach
    combines techniques from a number of existing implementations and is
    demonstrated to be more accurate than a range of commercial offerings.
    Combined with state of the art visual odometry based pose estimation we can
    use these point clouds to drive exploration.

  title: "Choosing Where To Go: Complete 3D Exploration with Stereo"
  location: ICRA, Shanghai, China
  date: May 2011
  authors: Robbie Shade and Paul Newman
  abstract:
    This paper is about the autonomous acquisition of detailed 3D maps of
    a-priori unknown environments using a stereo camera - it is about
    choosing where to go. Our approach hinges upon a boundary value
    constrained partial differential equation (PDE) – the solution of which
    provides a scalar field guaranteed to have no local minima. This scalar
    field is trivially transformed into a vector field in which following
    lines of max flow causes provably complete exploration of the
    environment in full 6 degrees of freedom (6-DOF). We use a SLAM system
    to infer the position of a stereo pair in real time and fused stereo
    depth maps to generate the boundary conditions which drive exploration.
    Our exploration algorithm is parameter free, is as applicable to 3D
    laser data as it is to stereo, is real time and is guaranteed to
    deliver complete exploration. We show empirically that it performs
    better than oft-used frontier based approaches and demonstrate our
    system working with real and simulated data

  title: "Discovering and Mapping Complete Surfaces With Stereo"
  location: ICRA, Anchorage, Alaska
  date: May 2010
  authors: Robbie Shade and Paul Newman
  abstract:
    This paper is about the automated discovery and mapping of surfaces using a
    stereo pair. We begin with the observation that for any workspace which is
    topologically connected (i.e. does not contain free flying islands) there
    exists a single surface that covers the entirety of the workspace.  We call
    this surface the covering surface. We assume that while this surface is
    complex and self intersecting every point on it can be imaged from a
    suitable camera pose and furthermore that it is locally smooth at some
    finite scale – it is a manifold.  We show how by representing the covering
    surface as a nonplanar graph of observed pixels we are able to plan new
    views and importantly fuse disparity maps from multiple views.  The
    resulting graph can be lifted to 3D to yield a full scene reconstruction.

  abstract:
    In this paper we describe a body of work aimed at extending the reach of
    mobile navigation and mapping. We describe how running topological and
    metric mapping and pose estimation processes concurrently, using vision and
    laser ranging, has produced a full sixdegree-of-freedom outdoor navigation
    system. It is capable of producing intricate three-dimensional maps over
    many kilometers and in real time. We consider issues concerning the
    intrinsic quality of the built maps and describe our progress towards
    adding semantic labels to maps via scene de-construction and labeling. We
    show how our choices of representation, inference methods and use of both
    topological and metric techniques naturally allow us to fuse maps built
    from multiple sessions with no need for manual frame alignment or data
    association.
