    I was a senior software engineer at <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>,
    in Cambridge, MA. I worked on networking infrastructure, and was involved in
    the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC">QUIC</a> project: developing
    a next generation transport protocol over UDP.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2016 I wrote the
    <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-shade-quic-http2-mapping-00">HTTP-over-QUIC spec</a>,
    which has become the basis for
    <a href="https://quicwg.org/base-drafts/draft-ietf-quic-http.html">HTTP/3 at the IETF</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2014, as part of the Google Developers Live series, I got the chance to
    talk about some of the work we have done, and where we hope to go next:

    We present our experience with QUIC, an encrypted, multiplexed, and
    low-latency transport protocol designed from the ground up to improve
    transport performance for HTTPS traffic and to enable rapid deployment and
    continued evolution of transport mechanisms. QUIC has been globally
    deployed at Google on thousands of servers and is used to serve traffic to
    a range of clients including a widely-used web browser (Chrome) and a
    popular mobile video streaming app (YouTube). We estimate that 7% of
    Internet traffic is now QUIC. We describe our motivations for developing a
    new transport, the principles that guided our design, the Internet-scale
    process that we used to perform iterative experiments on QUIC, performance
    improvements seen by our various services, and our experience deploying
    QUIC globally. We also share lessons about transport design and the
    Internet ecosystem that we learned from our deployment.

    In 2012 I successfully defended my DPhil (PhD). I was a member of the
    <a href="https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~mobile/">Mobile Robotics Group</a>
    at <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/">Oxford University</a>, under the supervision
    of <a href="https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~pnewman">Prof. Paul Newman</a>.
    My thesis focused on autonomous exploration, and developing novel approaches to
    solving this problem for robots capable of three dimensional movement.
    Most successfull is a method based on solving a partial differential
    equation across a voxelised representation of the robot's workspace: choosing
    suitable boundary conditions ensures complete exploration.

      For a mobile robot to engage in exploration of a-priori unknown
      environments it must be able to identify locations which will yield new
      information when visited.  This thesis presents two novel algorithms
      which attempt to answer the question of choosing where a robot should go
      next in a partially explored workspace.  To begin we describe the process
      of acquiring highly accurate dense 3D data from a stereo camera. This
      approach combines techniques from a number of existing implementations
      and is demonstrated to be more accurate than a range of commercial
      offerings. Combined with state of the art visual odometry based pose
      estimation we can use these point clouds to drive exploration.

      This paper is about the autonomous acquisition of detailed 3D maps of
      a-priori unknown environments using a stereo camera - it is about
      choosing where to go. Our approach hinges upon a boundary value
      constrained partial differential equation (PDE) – the solution of which
      provides a scalar field guaranteed to have no local minima. This scalar
      field is trivially transformed into a vector field in which following
      lines of max flow causes provably complete exploration of the
      environment in full 6 degrees of freedom (6-DOF). We use a SLAM system
      to infer the position of a stereo pair in real time and fused stereo
      depth maps to generate the boundary conditions which drive exploration.
      Our exploration algorithm is parameter free, is as applicable to 3D
      laser data as it is to stereo, is real time and is guaranteed to
      deliver complete exploration. We show empirically that it performs
      better than oft-used frontier based approaches and demonstrate our
      system working with real and simulated data

    <h2>Discovering and Mapping Complete Surfaces With Stereo</h2>

      This paper is about the automated discovery and mapping of surfaces using
      a stereo pair. We begin with the observation that for any workspace which
      is topologically connected (i.e. does not contain free flying islands)
      there exists a single surface that covers the entirety of the workspace.
      We call this surface the covering surface. We assume that while this
      surface is complex and self intersecting every point on it can be imaged
      from a suitable camera pose and furthermore that it is locally smooth at
      some finite scale – it is a manifold.  We show how by representing the
      covering surface as a nonplanar graph of observed pixels we are able to
      plan new views and importantly fuse disparity maps from multiple views.
      The resulting graph can be lifted to 3D to yield a full scene
      reconstruction.

      In this paper we describe a body of work aimed at extending the reach
      of mobile navigation and mapping. We describe how running topological
      and metric mapping and pose estimation processes concurrently, using
      vision and laser ranging, has produced a full sixdegree-of-freedom
      outdoor navigation system. It is capable of producing intricate
      three-dimensional maps over many kilometers and in real time. We
      consider issues concerning the intrinsic quality of the built maps and
      describe our progress towards adding semantic labels to maps via scene
      de-construction and labeling. We show how our choices of
      representation, inference methods and use of both topological and
      metric techniques naturally allow us to fuse maps built from multiple
      sessions with no need for manual frame alignment or data association.
